# Uber-Accessible
Submission for the 2023 Virtual Global Hackathon. An app created to make Uber rides more accessible in UberLand.

The files in this repository contain the code to run this program, but all files were initially coded in Replit. Here is the link to run the project through Replit: https://ugh.tigers-23-24.repl.co/

**Purpose:**
The purpose of Uber Accessible is to create a streamlined, easy access, Uber like web application for people who have disabilities or impairments that make either driving or getting around themselves extremely difficult or impossible without assistance. Uber accessible aims to provide an easy to use and understand booking ride app for people who might require special accommodations to go somewhere or extra assistance. 

**Function:**
Uber Accessible is a web application that can be used on any device that has access to the internet and a web browser. The purpose of this is to have Uber Accessible available to people who may not have access to a mobile device or other home computer. Public spaces such as libraries have free to use computers for the underprivileged to use to request special rides. 

Each person will have an account that they will create when they first access the web application. After creating an account they will be able to schedule a ride by clicking on the “Schedule Repeating Ride” button on the home screen. They will be able to set a time, date, location of pick up and drop off, and how often they would like their ride scheduling to repeat. This allows people who need assistance or special vehicles to get around and go do the things that they want to do without having to have a family member or friend take them. This gives the disabled and impaired a part of their independence back and puts less stress on their relatives.

Once a ride is scheduled the user will be sent back to the home screen where they can see their next up and coming ride as well as add another ride if they so wish.

There is an interactive calendar that can be used to select specific dates without typing them out as well as an easy drop down to select how often they want their ride to repeat.

There are four total screens, sign-up, home, user accessiblity needs, and scheduling a repeating ride.
